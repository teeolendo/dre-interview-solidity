# DRE INTERVIEW

If you're reading this, you're lucky enough to have made it to the technical interview. The task is to review the smart contract Exercise.sol with a view to making it compile and more gas-efficient.


The key question to ask yourself is what are the function trying to do. What is the goal of every function and finally what each function is meant to do.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
